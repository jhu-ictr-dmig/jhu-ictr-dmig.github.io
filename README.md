# JHU ICTR Data Management Best Practices

This site is meant to help researchers familiarize themselves with best practices and resources available for addressing the challenges of research data management. Github allows the DMIG to host these best practices on a version controlled site, with tools to facilitate keeping these practices and linked resources up to date.
