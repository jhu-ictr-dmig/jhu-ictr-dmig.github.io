# JHU ICTR Data Management Best Practices

This site is meant to help researchers familiarize themselves with best practices and resources available for addressing the challenges of research data management. Github allows the DMIG to host these best practices on a version controlled site, with tools to facilitate keeping these practices and linked resources up to date.




## How to Contribute

Best Practices are in the [_posts](https://github.com/jhu-ictr-dmig/jhu-ictr-dmig.github.io/tree/main/_posts) folder in the repository: each is in a [Markdown file (.md)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). New posts can be added to this folder: this will trigger the site to refresh, which can be monitored using the [actions](https://github.com/jhu-ictr-dmig/jhu-ictr-dmig.github.io/actions) page. This Github page was created using the [MinimalMistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) jekyll theme.




Users can suggest changes, using the tools of Github (issues, pull requests), or by reaching out via email and Teams. Join the ICTR Data Managers Interest Group channel on JH Teams.

### Opening Issues

If you have any suggested improvements, [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) at [our website's repository](https://github.com/jhu-ictr-dmig). These changes could be small improvements (identifying broken links, suggesting new resources) or large (new topics). If you have suggestions on changes, you can also [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).




### Setting Up:

Installing and configuring git and a text editor of choice is all that is needed. A useful guide for R users is [HappyGitWithR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html): while R/Rstudio are not required, this is still a valuable resource.
